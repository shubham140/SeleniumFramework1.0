# SeleniumFramework1.0

Hi All this is my first selenium framework. Basically it is a hybrid framework and i have using following tools with selenium webdriver.
*************************************************************************************************************
1. Test NG --> For creation of test cases and priortizing them according to requirements.
2. PropertiesFile --> To mask the pre defined data like driver location,driver name etc.
3. Extent Reports --> To get final output of test results i have integrated it with extent reports.
4. Log 4j --> To get daily logs of running test cases. I have customized logs in log4j xml file.
5. Jenkins --> I have integrated it with jenkins using profile tags in pom.xml

*************************************************************************************************************
